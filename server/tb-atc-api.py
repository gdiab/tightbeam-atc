"""tb-atc-api — the control plane for the Air Traffic Control view.

A deliberately small, dependency-free HTTP service holding three things in
memory: the page's current selection, a queue of commands for the page, and a
set of tags. Anything on the network may read or write it; there is no
authentication, by design, because it controls a display and nothing else.

The page polls /api/pull, applies any commands it has not seen, and reports
what it currently has selected. External callers use the verbs below.

    GET    /api/state                    everything at once
    GET    /api/selection[?clientId=id]  one viewer's selection, focus, and camera
    POST   /api/select                   {add:[id], remove:[id], clear:bool}
    POST   /api/focus                    {id, mode:"single"|"neighborhood"|"clear"}
    POST   /api/fit                      {on:bool}
    POST   /api/names                    {on:bool} — show/hide the agent-name display field
    POST   /api/annotations              {on:bool} — show/hide tags and arrows
    POST   /api/filter                   {ids:[id]} | {query:"text"} | {clear:true}
    POST   /api/arrows                   {arrows:[{from, to, text, color, source, author}]}
    GET    /api/arrows                   [{arrowId, from, to, text, color, source, author, at}]
    DELETE /api/arrows?author=<who>      clear that author's
    DELETE /api/arrows?all=true          clear every author's
    DELETE /api/arrows/<arrowId>         clear one
    GET    /api/help                     this service, documented for operators
    GET    /api/searches                 [{searchId, query, ids, label, source, author, at}]
    POST   /api/searches                 {searches:[{query|ids, label, author, searchId?}]}
    DELETE /api/searches/<searchId>      forget one
    DELETE /api/searches?author=<who>    forget that author's
    GET    /api/tags                     [{tagId, target, text, source, author, at}]
    POST   /api/tags                     {tags:[{target, text, source, color}]}
    DELETE /api/tags?author=<who>        clear that author's
    DELETE /api/tags?all=true            clear every author's
    DELETE /api/tags/<tagId>             clear one

`author` is who is speaking — a name a reader would recognise, e.g.
"watchdog:018". It is not a credential and nothing verifies it; it exists so a
board carrying several agents' notes can show who wrote what, and so an agent
tidying up can remove its own without taking everyone else's. A bare
`DELETE /api/tags` is refused for exactly that reason: say whose.
    GET    /api/pull?since=<seq>         page only: commands + tags

Node ids are the ones the feed publishes: work items as `wi_...`, agents as
their session suffix `s_...`. `type` is "item" or "agent".

It also serves the page itself, so one process is the whole installation: no
nginx, no second port, and the API sits at /api next to the page that uses it.

HELP = """# Tightbeam Air Traffic Control — operating the view

A live 3D display of this org. You are reading its own documentation; this
endpoint is the authority, and any skill or note that disagrees with it is
stale. `GET /api/help` returns this text; add `?format=json` for the endpoint
list as data.

There is no authentication. It drives a display and nothing else. Several
agents and at least one human share it at the same time, so everything below
about provenance and cleanup is about not trampling each other.

## What you can do

  read what viewers are looking at    GET  /api/selection
  read everything at once             GET  /api/state
  read the population                 GET  /data.json
  read what is waiting on George      GET  /data.json  (its `decisions` array)
  narrow the view to a set            POST /api/filter   {ids:[...], query|label}
  narrow the view by words            POST /api/filter   {query:"..."}
  point at one node                   POST /api/focus    {id, mode}
  add to what is selected             POST /api/select   {add:[...]}
  fly to the selection                POST /api/fit      {on:true}
  show/hide agent names               POST /api/names    {on:bool}
  show/hide annotations               POST /api/annotations {on:bool}
  pin a note to a node                POST /api/tags
  draw a relation between two         POST /api/arrows
  file/rename a search                POST /api/searches

## Ids

Work items are the substrate's full id, `wi_` and a UUID — the same string
`tightbeam work-item-get` accepts. Agents are their session suffix, `s_...`.
The feed's `short` field is for display only; act on `id`.

## Reading before writing

`/api/selection` returns every current viewer under `viewers`, and projects the
most recent report through the compatibility fields at the top level. Pass
`?clientId=<id>` to read only that viewer. Every result says which `clientId` it
describes and includes that viewer's camera pose.

Each viewer report contains several different things and they do not imply
each other:

  selected   what a human brushed
  focused    what a focus or filter is lighting, with `mode`
  decision   which Desk chip, if any, that viewer has open right now

A human's bare "these" or "this one" almost always means `selected`. Answering
about the wrong one is the most common way to be confidently useless here.

`decision` is `{id, question, raiserAgentId, workItemId, deadlineAt}` when a
Desk chip is open, `null` otherwise — set the moment a chip opens or closes,
the same way `focused` tracks a node focus. Asked "which decision do I have
selected?", read this rather than inferring it from the focus neighbourhood:
opening a chip also focuses the raiser, but the reverse is not true, and a
focus alone does not mean a decision is open.

## Searching, and naming what you searched for

`POST /api/filter` with `ids` narrows to a set; with `query` it runs the same
text match a human types. Every search is FILED as a card the human can click
to run again, so a filter is not a fleeting command — it leaves something
behind.

**Naming is required, not encouraged.** A filter carrying `ids` is REFUSED
without a `query` or a `label`, and so is a new card through /api/searches. The
refusal carries this guidance. Name it for WHAT WAS ASKED, not what matched:

  good   "everything blocking the 0.1.8 cut"
  good   "cards the reviewer has not seen"
  bad    "17 picked"
  bad    "filter"

The terms say what matched. The name says what the question was, and it is the
only thing a human reads when deciding whether to re-open your search an hour
later. A card without one is nearly useless to them.

  POST /api/searches {"searches":[{"searchId":"q7","label":"blocking the cut"}]}

edits a card in place — revise yours rather than filing near-duplicates.
Identical searches are refreshed, not stacked, so re-running one on a cadence
leaves a single card.

## Showing or hiding agent names

`POST /api/names {"on":false}` hides the agent-name field everywhere it is
displayed — the floating label, hover, the focus pane, tag/arrow authorship,
and a work item's own turn list all stop showing it. Role/archetype, id,
idle/workload and the rest of an agent's data are unaffected; this hides one
field, not the agent. `{"on":true}` shows it again. `GET /api/state` and
`GET /api/pull` both carry the current `namesVisible` value, so read before
you flip it if you are not sure which way it is set. It resets to shown on a
service restart.

## Annotating

## Showing or hiding annotations

`POST /api/annotations {"on":false}` hides all tag cards and every authored
arrow, including arrow geometry, heads, and labels. Tags and arrows remain in
the service, new annotations are still accepted, and the normal read endpoints
continue to return them. `{"on":true}` restores their rendering. `GET
/api/state` and `GET /api/pull` carry `annotationsVisible`; the setting resets
to shown on a service restart.

A hidden arrow is not clickable or focusable, because it is no longer visible.
This does not clear an existing Arrow Focus; its data still exists and it will
render again when annotations are restored.

A **tag** is a short label pinned above one node. An **arrow** is a labelled
curve between two, for a relation: blocks, owns, caused. Colour is yours from
`neutral red amber green cyan blue violet`, and means whatever you decide —
group a batch by colour rather than decorating each one differently.

**Always pass `author`** — a name a reader would recognise, like `watchdog:018`.
It renders under the note, and it is how you clean up your own work without
taking anyone else's: `DELETE /api/tags?author=watchdog:018`. An unqualified
clear-all is refused for that reason; `?all=true` exists for a human resetting
the board, not for you.

Short arrow labels ride the curve; long ones fall back to a card. Keep them to
two or three words and put the explanation in a tag.

## The Desk — operator decisions waiting on George

`GET /data.json`'s `decisions` array carries every OPEN `kind='operator'`
decision request — an agent asked (`operator-ask`), only George can answer
(`operator-rule`), and it expires on a deadline. Each entry: `id`, `question`,
`options` (label strings), `note` (the raiser's own PO-note context, if any),
`raiserId` (a readable identity string) and `raiserAgentId` (the board's own
short id for that session, if resolvable), `assignmentId`/`workItemId` (if the
request is tied to one), `ownerUserId`, `raisedAt`, `deadlineAt`. It is
generated straight from `decision_requests` in `state.db` (read-only) — never
by polling the `tightbeam` CLI, which is how a prior read loop grew state.db
to 4.9GB and crashed the VM (clickety-clacks/tightbeam#10).

The generator (not the page, and not you) is the sole author of `atc:desk`:
while a request is open and short of its deadline, it owns one red arrow
raiser → work item (`awaiting ruling`) and one red tag on the raiser
(`needs George · Nh`), both cleared the moment the row is ruled, withdrawn, or
past its deadline, and re-created if the same situation recurs. It also files
one search, `where George is needed`, over every open raiser and its work
item. Because it is the only writer of that author, `DELETE ...?author=atc:desk`
is always safe to run yourself if you want the board clear regardless — the
next generator tick simply re-files whatever is still actually open.

Agents never rule — only the two endpoints below do, and both require the
operator token George alone holds. Roci Desk is the other control surface;
ATC is a second one, not a replacement.

## Ruling and follow-ups (operator-token only)

Both endpoints require the operator token, sent either way: as the
`atc_operator` cookie GET / sets (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, path `/api`) —
the browser tab does this automatically, nothing to type or paste — or as
header `X-ATC-Operator: <token>` for a future non-browser client. The token
itself lives in `~/.tightbeam-atc/operator.token` (mode 600), generated on
first start, never served over HTTP directly. Wrong or missing token/cookie
→ 403. The cookie is a speed bump against accidental calls — a stray curl
or a careless agent — not a security boundary: the ruling identity (an
approved ATC device, `ruledViaSessionKey`) is the audit, once that lands;
until then the ATC-side ruling log below is the second trail.

`POST /api/decisions/<dr_id>/rule` — body `{decision:<label>} | {response:<text>}`,
plus `rationale` (required: at least one sentence; a long-enough free-text
`response` may serve as its own rationale, a picked `decision` label never
does). The row is read fresh from `state.db` (mode=ro) at click time — never
cached — and must be `kind='operator', status='open'`; a `decision` must
match one of the row's own `options[].label`. On success this makes ONE
`tightbeam operator-rule` call and writes a line to the ATC-side audit log
(`~/.tightbeam-atc/atc-rulings.log`) as a second trail independent of
whatever the gateway itself records.

`POST /api/decisions/<dr_id>/ask` — body `{question:<text>}`. Same row
checks. On success this sends ONE `tightbeam wake` to the row's raiser with
a fixed prompt asking them to answer by re-filing with `--supersedes
<dr_id>`, and records the follow-up (question, asked-at, the original
question/deadline) so the page can show "asked Nm ago — waiting" and later
render the superseding row in place of the original.

Neither endpoint runs on a cadence — each is exactly one gateway call, made
only when a human clicks, for the same reason `decisions[]` itself never
polls the CLI: clickety-clacks/tightbeam#10.

## Not fighting the human

The display changes under their hands. Prefer tagging, which is passive, over
focusing, which moves their camera. Say what you did and why. Clean up when the
question is closed. If they are mid-drag your commands are held until they lift
the pointer — that is deliberate, not lag.

## What the picture means

Agents hang below the grid as discs, laid out as the spawner tree; work items
float above it and descend a band per satisfied requirement. A ring on the
floor says whether the work reached the branch. An agent taking a turn wears a
rippling ring. Ghosted means faint and still there — nothing is ever hidden.

Layers stack: a search, then a fit (`f`), then a focus. The innermost renders.
A background click pops one layer; the mode strip at the bottom left names what
is in force.
